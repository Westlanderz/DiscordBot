# DiscordBot

This is my own discord bot called YAGPDB2U, Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot 2 Use
The goal is to make this a modular bot where everyone can make their own modules but it also comes with some default modules you can enable in your server.

To run the bot you need to first have node.js installed, take the latest LTS version. Then make sure you installed all dependenties by running 'npm i', without quotes.
Then you can run the bot by opening a terminal in that folder and running 'npm run start'.

This bot works on modules, to make your own module make a folder in the modules folder. In that folder you make a index.ts and every command in its own subfolder, to see how its done look into the Admin folder in modules.
